HPE OneView Mechanism Driver
============================

Overview
========
The Mechanism Driver dynamically reflects some networking operations made by
`OpenStack Neutron <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron>`_ to
`HPE OneView <https://www.hpe.com/us/en/integrated-systems/software.html>`_.
These operations allows the OneView administrator to know what is happening in
the OpenStack System, and automatizes some operations.

The following diagram describes an overview of how Neutron and OneView will
interact using the Mechanism Driver. This driver uses python-hpOneView to
provide communication between Neutron and OneView via REST API.

The OneView Mechanism Driver aims at having the Ironic-Neutron integration for
multi-tenancy working with nodes driven by the OneView drivers for Ironic.

How the driver works
====================

The OneView Mechanism Driver does not reflect all networking operations in
Neutron to OneView. To identify if a certain Neutron request should be
fulfilled, the Mechanism Driver checks if the networks and ports are related
with networks/connections created on OneView.

There are two cases regarding the usage of networks (both properties are in the
configuration file detailed in the following):

1. When the user wants to map a Neutron provider network to the OneViewUplinkSet,
so that every network/port operation on this provider network will be reflected
(created) on OneView. This mapping is made using the uplinkset_mappings property.
In this situation the administrator defines comma-separated triples of::

    uplinkset_mappings=<provider_network>:<logical_interconnect_group_uuid>:<uplink_set_name>

These can be related to two types of Uplink Sets:

- Ethernet Uplink Sets - to support VLAN networks.
- Untagged Uplink Sets - to support flat network.

2. When the user wants Neutron to be aware of a previously created network
on OneView, so that this network will be mapped onto a provider network, and
every port/connection operation using that provider network will use the mapped
network to attach to the connection on OneView. In this situation the administrator
defines comma-separated pairs of::

    flat_net_mappings=<neutron_provider_network>:<oneview_network_uuid>

In the case of port operations, only Neutron ports related to managed networks
with the *local_link_information* field populated are considered. The mechanism
driver also uses the information from the MAC address of the requested port, to
identify the specific NIC of the Server Profile where the operation should be
executed. This information can be directly configured in the Neutron port or
passed by the Ironic port field *local_link_connection*.

The driver also implements a fault tolerance process to guarantee that all networks
and ports that are present in Neutron are correctly reflected in OneView. To ensure
that, the verification is executed in the startup of the mechanism driver and
periodically after the initialization. This synchronization process considers the
information from the configuration file, and the information stored in the OneView
Mechanism Driver tables present in the Neutron Database.

Considering these assumptions, OneView Mechanism Driver is capable of the following:

- **Create a network** in OneView for each network creation request in Neutron to
  the physical provider-networks configured in the driver config file.

- **Add networks to Uplink Sets** in OneView for the mapped Uplink Set to the physical
  provider-network in the driver config file.

   - Ethernet Uplink Sets are used with vlan typed provider networks
   - Untagged Uplink Sets are used with flat typed provider networks

- **Manual mapping** of Neutron flat networks onto specified pre-existing
  networks of OneView.
- **Create, remove, and update connections** in Server Profiles,
  implementing Neutron port binding.

   - Works only when Neutron port with binding_vnic_type = baremetal
   - Expects Server Hardware ID and boot priority in the local_link_information of the Ironic port

- **Synchronization** of all networks and ports/connections, to provide fault tolerance.


Ironic Configuration
====================
By default, Ironic is configured to use flat networks during the deployment process.
In order to use Ironic-Neutron integration to provide networks isolation during
deployment, some configuration is necessary. In the ironic.conf file the following
configuration should be done:

::

    [DEFAULT]
    enabled_network_interfaces = flat,noop,neutron
    default_network_interface = neutron

    [neutron]
    cleaning_network = <neutron_cleaning_network>
    provisioning_network = <neutron_provisioning_network>


As mentioned in the previous section, the OneView Mechanism Driver needs
to receive the ``local_link_connection`` from Ironic ports to perform
networking ports operations. Once Ironic ports do not have any information
stored by default, it is necessary to update ports with the local-link-connection:

::

    openstack baremetal port set <port_uuid> --node <node> --local-link-connection switch_id=<switch_id> --local-link-connection switch_info='"{\"server_hardware_id\": \"<sh_id>\", \"bootable\": \"True\"}"' --local-link-connection port_id='' --pxe-enabled true

.. note::
   The Ironic OneView CLI creates Ironic ports and set “local_link_connection”.

**local_link_connection attributes**

- switch_id:  required, but the OneView Mechanism Driver does not deal
  directly with switches. switch_id receives any value in MAC format.
  Example: 01:23:45:67:89:ab
- port_id : required, but the OneView Mechanism Driver does not deal
  directly. port_id receives any value.
- switch_info: will be configured with information demanded by OneView
  Mechanism Driver.

   - server_hardware_id:  identifies in which Server Hardware the connection
     to represent the new port will be created
   - bootable: indicates if this connection will be bootable or not. It is
     required for performance deploy.

To identify the port where the connection needs to be created, the MAC address
already configured in the Ironic port will be used.

Install using OpenStack
=======================

To install the OneView Mechanism Driver, access the virtual environment on
Neutron Server Container::

   $ source /openstack/venvs/<neutron_venv>/bin/activate

To install the OneView Mechanism Driver, run::

   $ pip install networking-oneview

Configuration
=============

1. To configure Neutron ML2 plugin, access the file::

   /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini

- Add the OneView driver::

   mechanism_drivers = <other_drivers>,oneview

1.1 On both containers (Neutron Server and Neutron Agent):

- Insert the networks flat,vlan::

   tenant_network_types = vxlan,flat,vlan

- Insert the flat physical networks::

   [ml2_type_flat]

   flat_networks = public,<flat-physical-network1>,<flat-physical-network2>

- Insert the vlan physical networks::

   [ml2_type_vlan]

   network_vlan_ranges = public,<vlan-physical-network1>,<vlan-physical-network2>

2. To configure the OneView configuration, access the file:

   /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf_oneview.ini

.. note::
   If you are using TLS options for communication with OneView; it is necessary to
   download the credentials (appliance.com.crt) from OneView

::

   oneview_host=<hostname>
   username=<username>
   password=<password>
   uplinkset_mappings=<provider:logical_interconnect_group_id:uplink_name>,<provider2:logical_interconnect_group_id2:uplink_name2>
   flat_net_mappings=<provider3:oneview_network_id>,<provider4:oneview_network_id2>
   ov_refresh_interval=<oneview_refresh_internal>
   tls_cacert_file = <cacert_file_path>

3. In Neutron Agent, edit::

   /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/linuxbridge_agent.ini

Map neutron ports used by the container as follow::

   [linux_bridge]
   physical_interface_mappings = <flat-physical-network1-name:network-interface>,<vlan-physical-network1-name:network-interface>

4. Upgrading Neutron Database:

- Upgrade database::

   $ neutron-db-manage upgrade heads

- Edit the /etc/systemd/system/<neutron_directory>.service file.
   - In the property ExecStart add::

     --config-file /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf_oneview.ini

- Restart the neutron service::

   $ systemctl daemon-reload && service neutron-server restart

- Restart the neutron-agent container::

   $ service neutron-linuxbridge-agent restart

5. Configuring haproxy timeout in the outside container (host):

- To set the time on haproxy, edit both files::

   /etc/haproxy/conf.d/00-haproxy
   /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg

- In the defaults section of the files, change the following lines to::

   timeout client 300s
   timeout connect 10s
   timeout server 300s

- Restart the haproxy service::

   $ service haproxy restart
